A set of =display-buffer= actions to display buffers in a predictable way, to be used with =display-buffer-alist= and some helpers to manage windows & tabs

** Example
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist
               `(,(rx bot (or "*Help*" "*helpful" "*info*"))
                 (,(predictable-reuse-some-window (buf)
                                                  (->> buf
                                                       (buffer-name)
                                                       (string-match-p (rx bot (or "*Help" "*helpful" "*info*")))))
                  display-buffer-pop-up-window
                  predictable-reuse-largest-window)
                 (inhibit-same-window . t)))
